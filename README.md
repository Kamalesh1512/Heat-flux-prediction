    <li>Heat flux is the rate at which heat energy flows through a given surface or interface. It is typically measured in units of <b>watts per square meter (W/mÂ²)</b>, and it describes the amount of heat energy transferred per unit area per unit time. Heat flux is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and heat transfer, and it plays an important role in many <b>engineering and scientific applications</b>.</li><br>
    <li>Heat flux can be either a positive or a negative value, depending on the direction of heat flow. A <b>positive heat flux</b> indicates that heat is flowing into the surface, while a <b>negative heat flux</b> indicates that heat is flowing out of the surface. Heat flux is influenced by a variety of factors, including the temperature gradient across the surface, the thermal conductivity of the materials involved, and the nature of the heat source or sink.</li><br>
    <li>In general, heat flux is an <b>important concept for understanding and predicting heat transfer</b> in a wide range of physical systems, from simple heat conduction problems to more complex phenomena like convective heat transfer, radiation, and phase change.</li><br>
